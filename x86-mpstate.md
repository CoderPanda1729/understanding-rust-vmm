# x86-mpstate

The idea is manage the multiprocessing system. x86 goes through a sophisticated
booting mechanism called "Multiple-processor (MP) initialization". From section 8.4 
in Volume 3A, Part 1: 

> The MP initialization protocol defines two classes of processors: the
bootstrap processor (BSP) and the application processors (APs). Following a
power-up or RESET of an MP system, system hardware dynamically selects one of
the processors on the system bus as the BSP. The remaining processors are
designated as APs. 
>
> As part of the BSP selection mechanism, the BSP flag is set in the
IA32_APIC_BASE MSR (see Figure 10-5) of the BSP, indicating that it is the BSP.
This flag is cleared for all other processors. 
>
> The BSP executes the BIOSâ€™s boot-strap code to configure the APIC environment,
sets up system-wide data structures, and starts and initializes the APs. When
the BSP and APs are initialized, the BSP then begins executing the
operating-system initialization code.  
> 
> Following a power-up or reset, the APs complete a minimal self-configuration,
then wait for a startup signal (a SIPI message) from the BSP processor. Upon
receiving a SIPI message, an AP executes the BIOS AP configuration code, which
ends with the AP being placed in halt state. 
> 
> For Intel 64 and IA-32 processors supporting Intel Hyper-Threading Technology,
the MP initialization protocol treats each of the logical processors on the
system bus or coherent link domain as a separate processor (with a unique APIC
ID). During boot-up, one of the logical processors is selected as the BSP and
the remainder of the logical processors are designated as APs.

This state keeps the state of the multiprocessor. Has the processor started or
is waiting for signal?  From

This seems to give the guest the same environment as of real hardware.  When guest
boots up, only one processor will be marked `KVM_MP_STATE_RUNNABLE`.  Guest may
manage the Application Processors on its own. 

`vmm-reference` does create multiple CPUs but we did not see explicit calls to
`KVM_GET_MP_STATE`.  Perhaps, it is handled automatically when create VCPUs.

```
4.41 KVM_SET_BOOT_CPU_ID

Capability: KVM_CAP_SET_BOOT_CPU_ID
Architectures: x86
Type: vm ioctl
Parameters: unsigned long vcpu_id
Returns: 0 on success, -1 on error

Define which vcpu is the Bootstrap Processor (BSP).  Values are the same
as the vcpu id in KVM_CREATE_VCPU.  If this ioctl is not called, the default
is vcpu 0.
